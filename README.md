Exercises from Udemy course Test Automation with Selenium WebDriver in Java, by Julio de Lima (Automação de Testes com Selenium WebDriver em Java, in pt-BR)
Available at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/automacao-de-testes-com-selenium-webdriver-em-java/ "Automação de Testes com Selenium WebDriver em Java")

It is using JDK 1.8, Maven, Selenium WebDriver and JUnit

I tried to translate all Portuguese sentences to English. Not only to make it universally available, but as a strategy to pay more attention to the exercises, in order to avoid a copy-and-paste like course ;D

Hope it is helpful to you as it was to me.
